# Summary

The "Revolver" is a 3D printed puzzle with 41 independent moving parts that revolve / slide around a two part Retainer. The prints are all easy and straight forward and the result is really impressive... 

This is an alternative to the 6 colour version that features shapes that need to be grouped to solve the puzzle instead of grouping colours. This will suit people without enough filament colours or who don't want to go to the trouble to make it colorful. Refer to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1341294 to view the colour version. 

This is similar to a Rubik's cube in that the aim is to align / group matching shapes but there are two puzzles in one with the Revolver as you can align rows or columns to have all the same shapes in a line. 

One space is left to allow for the Sliders to move one space at a time. This means you need to plan your moves as you move towards your goal... of course you can pull it apart if you get frustrated with it and realign it that way but if you're really up for the challenge glue the thread so it will never come apart! 

The parts are all easy prints and assemble is very straight forward. This 'shape' version  does not need different filament colors like the 6 colour slider version . The images provided creates a great result. Black is used for the Retainer. All Revolvers and the Sliders are best printed in the same colour.  

As you need to leave one Slider out to make a space for movement it is recommended to leave out one of the vertical bar sliders ( | ) as the slot in the underlying Revolver looks similar so the empty space / gap is less noticeable (Refer to images for additional information). 

To achieve the end result does take time but it's well worth the effort. Print each .stl separately (Retainer / Revolvers / Sliders). Most machines capable of printing fine detail and good slicing apps should have no problem with the fine tolerances in this print. 
Watching it come together is satisfying... once it's together, and with the Slider shapes well messed up, it can be very frustrating... until you solve it and then it's very satisfying again!

Print the puzzle... then see if you can you do it? And, if you do... post images of your success!

Please refer to the print instructions and images for additional information. A zip file has been added with all of the slider files so they can be printed individually if necessary.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerBot
Printer: MakerBot Replicator 2
Rafts: Yes
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.20mm / Standard in PLA
Infill: 3 Shells / 35% Infill for the Retainer file. The Revolvers and Sliders can be 2 Shells and 20% Infill

Notes: 
Easy prints however the 'Retainer' file needs to be printed with 3 shells / 35% infill to ensure it is strong enough when screwed together. The other parts (Revolvers and Sliders) can be printed with 2 Shells / 20% infill as they don't need to be as strong. 

Note: Most accurate machines / good slicing apps should have no problems with these files however the tolerances are fine so other less accurate machines may not slide / rotate as easily or screw together easily. This has been tested on a Replicator 2 and 5th Generation Replicator with great results. 

# Post-Printing

## Assembly required... but it's quick and easy!

Remove the Raft then assemble the Sliders into the Revolvers. Make sure they all move freely / smoothly as the Sliders need to be able to move from Revolver to Revolver to solve the puzzle. 

One Revolver needs to be left with only 5 of 6 spaces filled (i.e. leave one out) as a space is required to allow you to move the sliders around one space at a time. This is what makes it challenging... like a Rubik's cube but round with rotating / sliding parts. 

Once the Revolvers / Sliders are assembled carefully place them onto the long part of the retainer. Once all are in place screw the second part of the Retainer (with the thread protruding) into the assembled Retainer / Revolvers / Sliders.. 

You only need to make it finger tight as you may need to unscrew it later if you can't solve it... although try not to cheat!

You can glue the thread so it will never come undone if you are up for the challenge...

Please refer to the images provided for additional information. A zip file has been added with all of the slider files so they can be printed individually if necessary. 

QUICK TIP: As you need to leave one Slider out to make a space for movement it is recommended to leave out one of the vertical bar sliders ( | ) as the slot in the underlying Revolver looks similar to the slider. This make sthe empty space / gap less noticeable.
